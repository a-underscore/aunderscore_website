This website is written in Python with the Flask framework, and is my first attempt at designing my own pages. I am a game developer, and work on games using Godot, but have also made games using Hex, my 2D renderer that is written with Rust  that uses Vulkan. I am a student at UNC Charlotte, with a major in computer science. As of writing this, I am currently in my sophomore year.</h2>
