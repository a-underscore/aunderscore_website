<div class="regular roboto-regular">Hi, Iâ€™m Brendan Bortz. Online, I go by the alias a_, or aunderscore. I have worked in Rust, Java, Python, C#, and Haskell. This website is written in Python with the Flask framework. I am a game developer, and work on games using Godot, but have also made games using Hex, my 2D renderer that is written with Rust (it now uses Vulkan!). I am a student at UNC Charlotte, with a major in computer science. As of writing this, I am currently in my sophomore year.</h1>
